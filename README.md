# Error Logging Service – Architecture Proposal

## 1. Overview

This document describes the architecture of an error logging platform. It
includes components for a client SDK, backend API, web dashboard, real-time
alerting, and a DevOps deployment strategy.

## 2. Architecture Components

### 2.1 Client SDK

A JavaScript SDK that developers include in their web applications to capture
runtime errors (`window.onerror`, `unhandledrejection`, try/catch) and send them
to the backend.

**Responsibilities:**

- Capture errors and user environment (browser, OS, app version).
- Send logs via HTTP to the backend.
- Retry mechanism if offline.

**Tech choice:** JavaScript library published to NPM (e.g.,
`@company/logger-sdk`).

---

### 2.2 API Backend

A REST API that accepts incoming log requests, validates them, and stores them
in a database.

**Stack:**

- **Node.js + Express** – easy JSON parsing, middleware-based logging.
- **Rate limiting** with middleware (e.g., `express-rate-limit`).
- **Validation** using `zod` or `joi`.

---

### 2.3 Database

Store error logs, metadata, and user/app context.

**Tech:**

- **PostgreSQL** – for structured log storage (error type, timestamp, message,
  project ID, etc.).
- **TimescaleDB** (optionally) – for better performance on time-series queries.
- **Redis** – for queuing/temporary caching if high traffic expected.

---

### 2.4 Web Dashboard

A React-based frontend for viewing logs.

**Features:**

- Filter logs by project, severity, date.
- View detailed stack traces.
- User auth and project separation.

**Stack:**

- **React + TypeScript** – for dashboard UI.
- **TailwindCSS / MUI / Antd** – UI framework.

---

### 2.5 Real-time Alerts

Send real-time notifications on critical errors via modern messaging platforms.

**Stack:**

- **Slack Webhooks / Telegram Bot API** – send alerts directly to channels in
  real-time mode.

---

### 2.6 DevOps & Scalability

**Infrastructure:**

- **Docker** – containerization.
- **Kubernetes** (optional) – scalable deployment.
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions / GitLab CI for test & deploy.
- **Log rotation / retention:** delete old logs after X days via cron or
  PostgreSQL TTL.

## 3. Key Decisions

| Area      | Decision                                               |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| SDK       | JS SDK using `fetch` with retry and context enrichment |
| API       | REST API with rate limiting & input validation         |
| Security  | API key per project, JWT for dashboard auth            |
| Alerts    | Email queue on critical severity errors                |
| Retention | Logs retained 30–90 days, configurable per project     |

## 4. Developer Questions for the Product Owner

1. What is the minimum required functionality for the MVP, and what is the expected delivery timeline for it?
2. Are there any wishes/restrictions on the use of technologies/services?
3. What regular meetings are expected (daily stand-ups, sprint planning, demos)?
4. Do you expect high-frequency logging? (e.g., frontends with 1M+ sessions)
5. Is real-time alerting needed for all severities or only critical ones?
6. Which platforms should the SDK support (Web, React Native, Node.js)?
7. Do we need auth/user context in the logs (e.g., user ID)?
8. Should we support grouping similar errors (e.g., by stack trace)?
9. What is the desired log retention policy?
10. Do logs need to be encrypted at rest?
