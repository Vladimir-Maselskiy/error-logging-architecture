# Error Logging Service – Architecture Proposal

## 1. Overview

This document describes the architecture of an error logging platform. It
includes components for a client SDK, backend API, web dashboard, real-time
alerting, and a DevOps deployment strategy.

## 2. Architecture Components

### 2.1 Client SDK

A JavaScript SDK that developers include in their web applications to capture
runtime errors (`window.onerror`, `unhandledrejection`, try/catch) and send them
to the backend.

**Responsibilities:**

- Capture errors and user environment (browser, OS, app version).
- Send logs via HTTP to the backend.
- Retry mechanism if offline.

**Tech choice:** JavaScript library published to NPM (e.g.,
`@company/logger-sdk`).

---

### 2.2 API Backend

A REST API that accepts incoming log requests, validates them, and stores them
in a database.

**Stack:**

- **Node.js + Express** – easy JSON parsing, middleware-based logging.
- **Rate limiting** with middleware (e.g., `express-rate-limit`).
- **Validation** using `zod` or `joi`.

---

### 2.3 Database

Store error logs, metadata, and user/app context.

**Tech:**

- **PostgreSQL** – for structured log storage (error type, timestamp, message,
  project ID, etc.).
- **TimescaleDB** (optionally) – for better performance on time-series queries.
- **Redis** – for queuing/temporary caching if high traffic expected.

---

### 2.4 Web Dashboard

A React-based frontend for viewing logs.

**Features:**

- Filter logs by project, severity, date.
- View detailed stack traces.
- User auth and project separation.

**Stack:**

- **React + TypeScript** – for dashboard UI.
- **TailwindCSS / MUI / Antd** – UI framework.

---

### 2.5 Real-time Alerts

Send real-time notifications on critical errors via modern messaging platforms.

**Stack:**

- **Slack Webhooks / Telegram Bot API** – send alerts directly to channels in
  real-time mode.

---

### 2.6 DevOps & Scalability

**Infrastructure:**

- **Docker** – containerization.
- **Kubernetes** (optional) – scalable deployment.
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions / GitLab CI for test & deploy.
- **Log rotation / retention:** delete old logs after X days via cron or
  PostgreSQL TTL.

## 3. Key Decisions

| Area      | Decision                                               |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| SDK       | JS SDK using `fetch` with retry and context enrichment |
| API       | REST API with rate limiting & input validation         |
| Security  | API key per project, JWT for dashboard auth            |
| Alerts    | Email queue on critical severity errors                |
| Retention | Logs retained 30–90 days, configurable per project     |

## 4. Developer Questions for the Product Owner

1. Which platforms should the SDK support (Web, React Native, Node.js)?
2. Do we need auth/user context in the logs (e.g., user ID)?
3. Should we support grouping similar errors (e.g., by stack trace)?
4. Do you expect high-frequency logging? (e.g., frontends with 1M+ sessions)
5. Do logs need to be encrypted at rest?
6. What is the desired log retention policy?
7. Is real-time alerting needed for all severities or only critical ones?
